# Tests against the gitignore specification v2.36.1


def test_predence():
    """
    Each line in a gitignore file specifies a pattern. When deciding whether to
    ignore a path, Git normally checks gitignore patterns from multiple
    sources, with the following order of precedence, from highest to lowest
    (within one level of precedence, the last matching pattern decides the
    outcome):

    Patterns read from the command line for those commands that support them.

    Patterns read from a .gitignore file in the same directory as the path, or
    in any parent directory (up to the top-level of the working tree), with
    patterns in the higher level files being overridden by those in lower level
    files down to the directory containing the file. These patterns match
    relative to the location of the .gitignore file. A project normally
    includes such .gitignore files in its repository, containing patterns for
    files generated as part of the project build.

    Patterns read from $GIT_DIR/info/exclude.

    Patterns read from the file specified by the configuration variable
    core.excludesFile.

def test_double_asterisk():

    Two consecutive asterisks ("**") in patterns matched against full pathname

    A leading "**" followed by a slash means match in all directories. For
    example, "**/foo" matches file or directory "foo" anywhere, the same as
    pattern "foo". "**/foo/bar" matches file or directory "bar" anywhere that
    is directly under directory "foo".

    A trailing "/**" matches everything inside. For example, "abc/**" matches
    all files inside directory "abc", relative to the location of the
    .gitignore file, with infinite depth.

    A slash followed by two consecutive asterisks then a slash matches zero or
    more directories. For example, "a/**/b" matches "a/b", "a/x/b", "a/x/y/b"

    Other consecutive asterisks are considered regular asterisks and will match
